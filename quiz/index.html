<!-- 
Build a function constructor called Question to describe a question. A question should include:
  - Question itself
  - The answers from which the player can choose the correct one (array)
  - Correct answer (I would use a number for this)
  - Use this quiz as the source: https://www.proprofs.com/quiz-school/story.php?title=html-basics-quiz_1
  - Store them all inside an array.

  - Select one random question and log it on the console, together with the selection of answers (each question should have a number) (Hint: write a function for the Question objects for this task)
  - Use the 'prompt' function to ask the user for the correct answer. The user should input the number of the correct answer.
  - Check if the answer is correct and print to the console whether the answer is correct or not (Hint: write another method for this)
